Certainly! Here's a review of the code I've written for the "Dice Party" game:

---

I created a web-based dice game called "Dice Party" using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows players to choose between multiplayer and single-player modes.

### HTML Structure:
- I structured the HTML to define the layout of the game, incorporating elements for dice images, game mode selection modal, result display, and scores.
- Included audio elements for sound effects during gameplay.

### JavaScript Logic:
- Implemented JavaScript functions to handle the gameplay mechanics for both multiplayer and single-player modes.
- Enabled the rolling of dice, switching between players, and determining winners based on dice rolls.
- Managed the modal display for selecting game modes and initializing the game accordingly.
- Incorporated event listeners to respond when players click on dice images to roll them.

### CSS Styling:
- Provided CSS styling to enhance the visual appeal of the game, including modal appearance, dice images, result displays, and game mode indications.
- Ensured responsiveness on smaller screens using media queries.

### Review of the Code:
- I maintained a clear separation between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a modular and organized structure for ease of maintenance.
- The JavaScript functions effectively managed the gameplay, distinguishing between multiplayer and single-player modes while determining winners based on dice rolls.
- CSS styling enhanced the overall user interface, making it visually appealing and adaptable to different screen sizes.
- For future improvements, I should consider adding comments to clarify complex logic and implementing error handling to manage unexpected user interactions, which would enhance the code's readability and reliability.
  
In summary, "Dice Party" is a functional dice game with intuitive gameplay and an appealing design. With some additional documentation and error handling, it can further elevate the gaming experience for users.
